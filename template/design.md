# DESIGN DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE

## Background

What experiment is this for? 

 
## Specification

What does the board need to do?

### Design tradeoffs

Note any issues which could be handled in more than one way and justify the approach taken?

### Design for assembly

How will you put it together e.g. if using cable connections, how will these be manufactured?

### Design for reliability

Things go wrong with assembly and usage, even with the best of staff working on the job. So how will your design prevent itself from being damaged by accidental or even malicious misuse, e.g. reversed power supplies, or wrong power supply, incorrect peripheral connections etc (especially where terminal blocks are used, because polarity cannot be enforced very easily).

### Design for maintenance 

What parts are likely to fail, and how will they be replaced?


## Part  details

List here any helpful details which can assist in the review process, such

### Part 1

Which part, and variant(s) are you using?

#### Sourcing

Where can you get it from?

#### Size, orientation

How big is it, and which way round does the footprint need to be on the PCB? How much clearance is needed around the part e.g. for putting in wires to terminal blocks

#### Supply considerations

What is the typical, and absolute supply voltage(s)?

#### Application considerations

What supporting components are needed? 

#### Electromagnetic compatibility considerations

Note any components which should be close together, far apart, and any track length considerations
